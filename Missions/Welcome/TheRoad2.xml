    <subject>Building Servers</subject>
    <body>So.. You appearently aren't a total dipshit. so i hope you know how building servers works... I made a few files you will need. 2 files which you need FOR EVERY SERVER YOU MADE (dun delete it). And the file you will need for that one server.
    Attached are the SilkRoad's proxy and my personal dropserver.
    (Upload from your proxy server!)
