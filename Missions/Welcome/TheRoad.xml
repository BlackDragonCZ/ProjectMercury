    <subject>Welcome to the Deep Web!</subject>
    <body>Alright! So your interested. I'll test you in a few ways. Let's start with this one. I have a proxy setup somewhere on the deep web so connect to the pc and see if you can find it. TIP: in tor/logs you should place a file like "Connected: (FAKE-IP)" so they won't find you! (Maybe also delete the one with your ip)
